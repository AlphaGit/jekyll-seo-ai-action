sandbox:
  install:
    - npm install
  check:
    - npm test
    - npm run build
 
rules:
 - There should not be large sections of commented out code.
 - Implementations should be simple, straightforward, and clean.
 - Any change in the installation process should be documented in the README.md markdown file.
 - Tests need to pass after implementing changes. This might require changes to files under the test/ directory.
 - Because this works as a Github Actiion, most of the feedback to the user is done through console commands. Seeing them in the execution of the tests is not an error.
